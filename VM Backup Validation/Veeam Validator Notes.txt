# Veeam Validator Notes
# Veeam Backup Validator Report - Validate VM Last Backup

# This script validates all virtual machines last backup of the Veeam Backups Jobs. 
# It checks the backup files via CRC at the file level. 
# For the integrity validation of the backups the Validator uses the checksum algorithm.
# After each creation of a backup file, Veeam calculates a checksum for every data block in the backup file and will attach the checksums to them.
# The Veeam Backup Validator re-calculates the checksums for data blocks and compares them with the initial written values.

# Ideas:
# Possible integration into LT so you can pull up the MGT/VEEAM device view and see the results of the VM validation?
# Upload results in HTML to IT Glue maybe monthly like how in CW we have the last verified, this would be the same but with more details
# LT script to run maybe monthly and then results get uploaded to IT Glue
